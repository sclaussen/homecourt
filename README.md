This was a programming problem my son was working on in Python related
to obtaining pins in the Homecourt basketball mobile application we
use to track shots.

Write a Python program to determine what the probability of getting
the one Utah Jazz pin we are missing each turn when the following
teams have x4 probably today:

- Utah Jazz, LA Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies

76ers: 5
trailblazers: 3
bucks: 4
bulls: 4
cavs: 4
celtics: 3
clippers: 3
